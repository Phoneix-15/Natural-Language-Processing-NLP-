# Natural-Language-Processing (NLP)
IMDB movie reviews dataset is used to train our NLP model. 
This model after training can predict the NEXT word and auto-complete a sentence or paragraph. This language model is also used as a classifier.
It can read a new movie review and can classify it as a "positive" or "negative" review.
